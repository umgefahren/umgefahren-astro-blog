### Gyeongbokgung Palace

The Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest of the five palaces in Seoul. It was built in 1395 and served as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty.
It was destroyed by the Japanese in the 16th century and rebuilt in the 19th century. It is located in the north of Seoul and is surrounded by the Bukhansan National Park.
This is the view from inside the palace towards the south gate and the Gwanghwamun Square.
